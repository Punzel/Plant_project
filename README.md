# Plant_project
A project where I want to set up a database about animal friendly plants for home, balcony and yard. For the start i go with cat friendly plants.  Right now I am working on displaying the images of plants properly.

THIS PROJECT IS RIGHT NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!

I have a long to do list still with things I want to add to this project. The code is still a little messy and will be sorted and commented more and better :)
